# This is the 'About Me' Section
## Welcome

My name is Alison and I'm a \*Designer. No, the asterisk isn't a typo. It's an innovative new title I've given to myself. Taken from the programming concept, the asterisk represents a *wildcard* -- a fill-in-the-blank.
I've had experience as a UX Designer, a Graphic Designer, a Web Designer, a Drafter/Designing... the list goes on, but the final word doesn't change. The core of all my interests is *design*, from architecture to websites, from information architecture to branding. 
In accordance to my newly-minted title, I have similarly made my website a \*Portfolio, containing all the best of my various projects, regardless of their industry or application. One thing I hope you notice as you peruse my work is that they all come down to *design*.
