A full branding system for a down-to-earth coffee shop, complete with logos, colors, and a website.

## The Logo
The logo represents a home, with a hearth inside of it, as well as the hearth itself with a fire inside.
The shape of the fire intentionally resembles a crown, to show the luxury that can be found in simple, rustic food and drink.
